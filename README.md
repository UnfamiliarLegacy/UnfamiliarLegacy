### UnfamiliarLegacy

I am leaving the scene and will leave behind some (private) projects of mine.  
You might know me as **Mikee#0055** from discord and/or [my work done to Arcturus Morningstar](https://git.krews.org/morningstar/Arcturus-Community/-/commits/dev?author=Mike).

A mirror of the repositories can be found at GitLab [here](https://gitlab.com/Unfamiliar).

Do not bother looking for me, thank you.

Bye.
